# Loan Approval Bayesian Net

Bayesian Network which can Infer that a person get Loan Approved or Not by providing Evidence. 

The problem statement is “A Company wants to automate the loan approval process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others”. Here target is Loan Status which has two values yes or no. yes means that Loan Approved and no means Loan is not Approved.

Here I am going to build a Bayesian network with Loan Approval dataset. Where it can infer that a person will get Loan Approved or not by providing Evidence.

Dataset:
Loan Approval dataset consists of Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoaaplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status. Here Loan_Status variable is Target.
